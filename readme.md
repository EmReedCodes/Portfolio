# Portfolio 3.0


## Description

This is my third iteration on a Portfolio. The first one I did rather early on in my coding days and I was just never quite happy with it. Once a little time had passed and I had some more skills I decided it was time for my ultimate "Me" portfolio. I am very happy being able to use React Vite and adding a bit of my own flair to it. You may wonder but if this is version 3 what happened to version 2? We don't talk about version 2.
